# Generalized-Linear-Models-
I've coded up a generalized linear model class for solving problems with responses following exponential family of distributions. So far I've included Logistic Regression and Poisson Regression. The solvers used are Newtonian (Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares)

#   TODO

1. Add support for regularization
2. Add support for kernel methods
3. Add Support for Softmax regression in Logistic Case
4. Add support for automatic One Vs. All
